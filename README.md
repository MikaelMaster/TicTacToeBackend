# TicTacToeBackend - Backend for Tic Tac Toe Game 🕹️

This is the backend for a project I worked on with my friend [Guilherme](https://github.com/guilhermehnf), who handled most of the frontend using Next.js. I built the backend with Ktor and WebSockets. While I already have extensive experience working with Ktor and building REST APIs, this project served as a great opportunity for me to dive into **WebSockets** specifically, and learn how to handle real-time communication in Ktor. 🔥

You can check out the frontend here: [TicTacToe Frontend](https://github.com/guilhermehnf/tictactoe-frontend). 🎮

### About Access to the Game 🚪
At the moment, the game is not hosted, so you can't play it online yet. However, Guilherme and I plan to host it in the future so everyone can join the fun. 🌍

### What’s Inside this Repo? 📂
In this repository, you'll find the code that shows how I implemented the game logic using both REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time communication. Feel free to explore the code and see how it was built! Pull requests are also welcome! 👨‍💻💡
